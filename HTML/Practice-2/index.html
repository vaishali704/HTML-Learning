     <b style="color:green;">Palampur Tea Gardens:</b>  Palampur Tea Gardens are integral to the region's
      identity and economy. Palampur is also regarded as the Tea Capital of
      Northwestern India[10] and produces the famous "Kangra Tea". Established
      in 1849 by Jameson and British officers, these gardens have a rich
      heritage in tea cultivation. Despite facing challenges such as the 1905
      Kangra earthquake, which affected their international market presence,
      these gardens continue to produce Kangra Tea, a local speciality. A tea
      processing factory in the area further supports the tea industry,
      highlighting its significance beyond tourism.
